# Python-Projects
This repo contains some of the projects I have done to learn python, All the projects have original code.
All code is explained in beginner friendly manner.

### Tools Used: 
- VS Code, 
- Jupyter Notebook, It is an opensource web based IDE that allows you to run and share live code, visualizations, equations etc.
However you can also use any of the many IDEs that support python to run all of the codes shared here, like pycharm, visual studio etc, infact if you are a beginner I suggest jupyter notebook as it is better in debugging errors and visualising the large code blocks.

### Content:
1. TIC TAC TOE : This is the classic tic tac toe game that is designed to be played by two players or played with the computer. The code is simple and covers some of the general functions used in python.

2. BLACKJACK : This is a classic card game that is played against the computer. The code is a little more complex and covers classes, functions, stlye formating and most of the general functions in pythons.

3. Simple Text to Speech program: A program that utilises the gTTS(Google text to speech) library to say a personalised greeting message to users.

4. American Sign Language Classification using CNN : This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using PyTorch. The model architecture consists of three convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers, designed to classify images into 24 different categories.

5. Foundations of Algorithmic Thinking : This Project contains various python programs for sorting, searching, shortest distance finding etc that were created as part of the online course Foundations of Algorithmic Thinking by Robin Andrews, Compucademy
