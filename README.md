# Python-Projects
This repo contains some of the projects I have done to learn python, All the projects have original code.
All code is explained in beginner friendly manner.

Tools Used: Jupyter Notebook, It is an opensource web based IDE that allows you to run and share live code, visualizations, equations etc.
However you can also use any of the many IDEs that support python to run all of the codes shared here, like pycharm
