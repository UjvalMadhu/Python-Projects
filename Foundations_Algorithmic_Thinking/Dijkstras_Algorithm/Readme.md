# Project Name: Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest distance in a weighted graph

 The goal of this project is to find the shortest distance between two nodes A and C in a weighted graph, the graph is illustrated in the readme file.

## Description

The program implements a graph structure using dictionaries and creates visualization of the structure using matplotlib.
There is a function that can calculate the shortest distances for any graph structure for any source node.
Finally the graph structure and a table containing the shortest distances are displayed as output.

### Program Structure:


- Dijkstras1.py (main file)
- - Section to develop the graph structure and visualize it
- - Function for Dijkstra;s Algorithm on any graph structure
- - Section to create the table of shortest distances
