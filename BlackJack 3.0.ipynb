    "BlackJack is a classic card game. It is designed here to be played against the computer as the dealer.\n",
    "The goal of the game is to not get to go above a sum of 21 in hand.\n",
    "The rules of the game are as follows:\n",
    "1. From a shuffled deck of cards 2 cards are handed to the player and the dealer.\n",
    "2. The player's cards are displayed but the dealers last card is kept hidden.\n",
    "3. Next the player can choose to 'Hit' meaning to get a card from the deck or 'Stand' meaning to skip getting a card from the deck. The player and dealer go through each round alternatively, but can only 'Stand' for three rounds in a row and will have to 'Hit' in the fourth round in this case.\n",
    "4. The first to not get a value above 21 in hand wins the game and the bet.\n",
    "5. You can choose to buy chips to place bets and track your chips in this game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Card Values\n",
    "There are four suits in a deck- \"Hearts',\"Diamonds\",\"Spades\" and \"Clubs\" having 13 cards in each suit ,constituting of 52 total cards.\n",
    "There are 9 numbered cards and 4 face cards in each suit.\n",
    "The numbered cards (2 to 10) of each of the four suits have the same value per card as their respective number indicates.\n",
    "The face cards 'King', 'Queen' and 'Jack' have vales of 10 each. and 'Ace' cards can have a value of 11 or 1, which is automatically adjusted if total value goes above 21. "

    "The game is designed in python and is intended for learning purposes.The code uses Classes, Functions, loops, try-except, Conditional statements and some general python functions.\n",

    "Here we import the random module so that we can use the random function to shuffle our cards. We also define global variables which can be accessed thoughout the code to define our deck of cards."
